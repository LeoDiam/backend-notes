## 1. 了解 Springboot

### 1.1 What is springboot?

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

- Create stand-alone Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to **simplify your build configuration**
- **Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries** whenever possible
- Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
- Absolutely no code generation and **no requirement for XML configuration**
