## Queries with expressions

1. List all movies and their combined sales in **millions** of dollars

   ```sql

   JOIN 
   	boxoffice 
   ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id;
   ```

   

2. List all movies and their ratings **in percent**

   ```sql

       boxoffice 
   ON 
       movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id;
   ```

   

3. List all movies that were released on even number years

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       title
   FROM 
       movies

   ```

   

## Queries with aggregates

1. Find the longest time that an employee has been at the studio

   SELECT 
       MAX(years_employed)
   FROM 
       employees;
   ```

   

2. For each role, find the average number of years employed by employees in that role

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
       role, AVG(years_employed)

   GROUP BY 
       role
   ```

   â€‹         

3. Find the total number of employee years worked in each building

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
       building, SUM(years_employed)
   FROM 
       employees
   GROUP BY 
       building;
   ```

   

   ## Queries with aggregates II

   1. Find the number of Artists in the studio (without a **HAVING** clause)
